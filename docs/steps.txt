Work plan (ongoing)
====================

1) Formation templates for 4-3-3 variants (CDM, CAM) – DONE
   - Added src/formations.py with role slots and hints.

Next steps to tackle:
2) Define constraint schema + baseline optimizer loop (greedy/local search) using these formations. – DONE
   - Added src/team_optimizer.py with TeamConstraints, greedy selector, and role-weighted scoring.
3) Playstyle-aware role fit scoring tied to slots. – DONE
   - Enhanced team_optimizer scoring with role-to-playstyle prefs and bonuses.
4) Team Competitiveness Index (positional fit, synergy, depth). – DONE
   - Added TCI computation to team_optimizer (positional fit, role/playstyle fit, style compliance, line balance) with a 0–100 composite.
5) Upgrade optimizer (GA/CP-SAT) once scoring pieces are ready. – PARTIAL (GA)
   - Added simple genetic search option alongside greedy in team_optimizer.
6) Agent integration and output formatting for teams/TCI and transfers – DONE
   - Added build_team and suggest_transfers tools with optimizer/TCI wiring and JSON cleaning.
