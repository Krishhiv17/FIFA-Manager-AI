Work plan (ongoing)
====================

1) Formation templates for 4-3-3 variants (CDM, CAM) – DONE
   - Added src/formations.py with role slots and hints.

Next steps to tackle:
2) Define constraint schema + baseline optimizer loop (greedy/local search) using these formations. – DONE
   - Added src/team_optimizer.py with TeamConstraints, greedy selector, and role-weighted scoring.
3) Playstyle-aware role fit scoring tied to slots.
4) Team Competitiveness Index (positional fit, synergy, depth).
5) Upgrade optimizer (GA/CP-SAT) once scoring pieces are ready.
6) Agent integration and output formatting for teams/TCI.
