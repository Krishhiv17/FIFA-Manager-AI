1) Team build (balanced, default-ish)
Prompt:
Build me a balanced 4-3-3 (CAM) team. Budget €500,000,000. Max age 29. Minimum overall 82. Reserve 10% for GK. Bench size 3. No mandatory or blocked players. Report XI, bench, TCI, and any relaxations you applied.

Output:
This balanced 4-3-3 (CAM) team, with a total value of €482,000,000, features a strong defense led by Denzel Dumfries at right back, Gianluca Mancini and Edmond Tapsoba in the center, and David Raum at left back. In midfield, Federico Valverde and Jorginho form a dynamic duo, while Lorenzo Insigne takes on the creative playmaker role. Wilfried Zaha and Rafael on the wings provide pace, and Tammy Abraham leads the line as a poacher. De Gea guards the goal as a shot-stopper. The bench features Marc Bartra, Rafael Toloi, and Lucas Vazquez. The team's TCI is 82.9, with a positional fit of 88.0, role playstyle fit of 88.0, style compliance of 80.0, line balance of 80.8, and depth of 47.0. The team had to relax the max age to 31 and the minimum overall to 81 to fit within the budget.

2) Team build (high_press, tight age/overall)
Prompt:
Build a high press 4-3-3 (CDM) team. Budget €450,000,000. Max age 27. Minimum overall 80. GK reserve default. Bench size 3. No mandatory/blocked. Tell me XI, bench, TCI, and any relaxations.

Output:
The team is a 4-3-3 (CDM) high press formation with a total value of €429,000,000 and an average overall of 81.3. The team consists of Aaron Wan-Bissaka at right back, Lukas Klostermann at right center back, and Obite Evan N'Dicka at left center back.

Marcus Rashford is the striker, supported by Martin Terrier on the right wing and Otávio on the left wing. Unai Simón is the goalkeeper. The bench consists of Javi Galán, Rick Karsdorp, and Mario Hermoso. There are no relaxations in this team.

3) Transfers (possession)
Prompt:
Suggest 3 replacements for V. Osimhen at ST for a possession team. Budget €300,000,000, max age 30, minimum overall 82, desired playstyle: Poacher.

Output:
Replacements for V. Osimhen at ST | style possession | suggestions 3
- R. Lukaku (Poacher) | pos ST | overall 86.0 | value €68,000,000
- Diogo Jota (Poacher) | pos ST | overall 85.0 | value €76,000,000
- Gerard Moreno (Poacher) | pos ST | overall 85.0 | value €53,000,000

4) Player comparison (GK sanity)
Prompt:
Compare Courtois and De Gea. Include dataset value/overall/position and predicted value/overall/position for both, and note if predicted positions differ from actual.

Output:
Thibaut Courtois is predicted to be more valuable than David De Gea, with a predicted value of 66,063,968 EUR compared to 43,711,524 EUR for De Gea. Courtois is also predicted to have a slightly higher overall rating, 88.3 compared to 85.4 for De Gea. Both players are predicted to remain goalkeepers, with Courtois having a 99.9% probability of being a goalkeeper and De Gea having a 100% probability. However, it's worth noting that the model predicts a small chance of Courtois playing as a center back or striker, which is unlikely given his actual position. The predicted values are estimates based on FIFA-style stats and may not reflect the players' actual market value.
